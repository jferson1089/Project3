## Project 3

### Full Stack Application Description

# Project Overview

-We propose the creation of a full stack application, Twitter clone. Using a back end with full CRUD abilities from the front end to populate
data that the user posts. Styled in moderb mobile first approach, then scaling up to the desktop applications. We would like our users to be able to post their content, and have others comment on the posts.
Front end will be using React while backend will be a Express, Mongo, and Mongoose.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.


### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
- Completeing and Deploying the Database
- Front end React app
- Allow user to interact with the page
-Favoriting Comments
-Mobile First
-Displaying Users
-Displaying Comments
-Creating new comments


#### PostMVP 

-Additional styling
-


## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Main | Will include the main navigation of the page | 
| Feed | This is where users and favorites will render depending on the link | 
| Users| This will display a random amount of users|
| Create | This will be the post section



Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Creating Data Base | H | 10hrs | |
| React Front End | H | 2hrs|  |  |
| React Components| H | 2hrs | |
| Communicate from Front to Backend | H | 5 hrs|  |  |
| Total | H | 0 |  | |
